# Exercise3

By following the instructions I made the Dockerfile, built the app and ran it to my localhost:8080
And hooray! I saw the app running saying: "Hello! I am a Flask application running on 005be02208e6"

I made a container from the layer "CMD...." and could browse that.

Eventually I removed the container and image.
